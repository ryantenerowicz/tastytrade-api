## USAGE

Here's an example of how to use the Tastytrade API client:
```python
from tastytrade_api.authentication import TastytradeAuth

username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# Initialize the authentication object
auth = TastytradeAuth(username, password)

# Log in to the API
auth_data = auth.login()

if auth_data:
    print("Successfully logged in!")
else:
    print("Failed to log in.")

# Validate the session
is_valid = auth.validate_session()

if is_valid:
    print("Session is valid.")
else:
    print("Session is invalid or expired.")

# Destroy the session (log out)
if auth.destroy_session():
    print("Successfully logged out.")
else:
    print("Failed to log out.")
```
